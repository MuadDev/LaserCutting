# Dutch Ice Skater Collection
Hangers with scene's from a Dutch ice skater.

# Tools
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for designing the SVG files.
- [LaserSaur](https://www.lasersaur.com/) for laser cutting.

# Tips
- The `template.svg` file can be used for a quick start.
- The `parts` directory contains the individual SVG object files used in each scene.
- When a layer has been designed use the boolean operations in Inkscape to cut with the round circels from the `template.svg` to make the scene fit inside the hanger. 
- Each file already contains the Lasersaur settings used in the `text` sections.
