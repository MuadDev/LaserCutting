# Dutch Ice Skater Collection
Pendants with scene's from a Dutch ice skater.

Each `SVG` file contains 3 parts consisting of red and blue lines. These are the lines meant to be cut.  
Besides this they also contain a single black and gold figure, which serves as an example for the painted and finished hanger.

# Tools
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for designing the SVG files.
- [LaserSaur](https://www.lasersaur.com/) for laser cutting.

# Tips
- The `template.svg` file can be used for a quick start.
- The `parts` directory contains the individual SVG object files used in each scene.
- When a layer has been designed use the boolean operations in Inkscape to cut with the round circels from the `template.svg` to make the scene fit inside the hanger. 
- Each file already contains the Lasersaur settings used in the `text` sections.
- When painting, start with the back so that when that has dried you can immediately turn it over and paint the front and leave that drying longer.
