# Christmas Ball Designs

## Template
A starting point with preset LaserSaur cut values for creating christmas balls.

### Tips
- Design a patter such that the cut out itself can be an ornament too if possible.
- Remember to cut out the figure first, then the surrounding christmass ball.
- Do not cut too small, as the laser appears to have some "width" while cutting.
- Rotate the view such that the top of the christmass ball is at the top of the view.
- Design each christmas ball in a separate file. This prevents an error -- e.g. in cut settings -- from ruining multiple balls.

### FAQ
