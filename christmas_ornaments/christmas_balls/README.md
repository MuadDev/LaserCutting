# Christmas Ball Designs

## Template
A starting point with preset LaserSaur cut values for creating christmas balls

### Tips
- Design a patter such that the cut out itself can be an ornament too if possible.
- Remember to cut out the figure first, then the surrounding christmass ball.
- Do not cut too small, as the laser appears to have some "width" while cutting.
